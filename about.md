It started with a need to release a Static library as a product and include some resources in it. 
That is usually impossible since a program that uses such Static library will use its own resources. 
I posted a question (which I answered after finding this solution). 
I realized that this solution deserves an article with source code. 
I have also posted a question about that possibility in Stack Overflow.
